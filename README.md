# Ansible 

- This folder holds all of the Ansible roles I've created so far... with all of the roles combined one should be able to fully deploy a CentOS or FreeBSD box with a little help from a kickstart or package set. 
- Documentation is included with every role
- The role name is typically the name of the service it manages
- Several of these roles have dependencies on each other so it's important to read the meta file included!
